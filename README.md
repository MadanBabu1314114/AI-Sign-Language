# AI Sign Language Recognition with OpenCV


## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust and efficient sign language recognition system using artificial intelligence and computer vision. The application utilizes the power of OpenCV for image processing and gesture recognition to interpret sign language gestures captured through a webcam.

## Features

- Real-time sign language recognition using computer vision.
- Pre-trained deep learning model for accurate gesture classification.
- User-friendly interface with webcam integration.
- Extensible architecture for adding custom gestures.


## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-sign-language.git
   cd ai-sign-language
